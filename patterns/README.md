Patterns -> nested loops

|      | c   | c   | c   | c   |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| rows | X   | X   | X   | X   |
| rows | X   | X   | X   | X   |
| rows | X   | X   | X   | X   |
| rows | X   | X   | X   | X   |

1. For outer loop -> count the number of lines(rows).

2. For the inner loop -> focus on the columns and connect them somehow to the rows.

3. Whatever you are printing -> print them inside the inner loop.

4. Observe symmetry (optional).
